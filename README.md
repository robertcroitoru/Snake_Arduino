# Snake_Arduino

This is my version of a Snake game on an Arduino Nano.

When first connected to power, the "Start Game" menu is displayed. In order to start the game, the player is required to press the START button which is located closest to the OLED display. 
Once the game starts, the player needs to press one of the 4 existing buttons in order to make the snake move. As soon as the snake starts moving, the player needs to press the 4 buttons representing the direction that the snake will head to. 

After consuming the "food" displayed, the snake's length will increase and it will become harder to play beacuse it can collide with itself.
If the snakes hits the "frame" of the game, a "GAME OVER" message will be displayed. If the current score is higher than the previous high score, a new high score will be displayed on the Start Menu.

Required uqipment:

1. Arduino Nano
2. Breadboard
3. 0.96" OLED display
4. 5 buttons
5. Male-male jumper wires
6. Solid wires
7. Usb power cable
